        <p><strong>Fusion of Art and Personal Stories</strong></p>
        <p>The &quot;Voice Notes&quot; project is an international creative writing and sound arts initiative that amplifies the voices of individuals who have experienced forced displacement. Led by poet Dr. Sarah Jackson from Nottingham Trent University and funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the project explores the role of telephony in experiences of exile. Collaborating with sound artist Hardi Kurda and refugee arts charity Compass Collective, &quot;Voice Notes&quot; engages to share individuals stories through voice notes, fostering new conversations about communication, displacement, and creativity. ​</p>
        <p>As the lead graphic designer for this project, I was tasked with translating these powerful narratives into compelling visual representations, crafting a cohesive visual identity that resonates with the project&#x27;s themes and honors the diverse experiences of its participants.​</p>
        <p><strong>Visualizing Diverse Voices</strong></p>
        <p>My design approach centered on encapsulating the emotional depth and cultural richness of the participants&#x27; stories. This involved creating a series of postcards, posters, a book cover, app cover pages, and the design and implementation of the website. Each piece aimed to encapsulate the project&#x27;s essence and the diverse voices it represents.​</p>
        <p>Participating in the workshops with numerous authors was an extraordinary experience. Despite my lack of prior writing experience, I found immense joy in listening to others. Certain phrases have stayed with me, inspiring me to preserve these feelings visually, to convey the atmosphere and highlight the diversity while uniting everything cohesively. A broad color palette, typography accommodating various languages and scripts, and original art drawings became my tools in this endeavor.​</p>

        </figure>
        <p>‍<strong>Designing for Impact</strong></p>
        <p>Designing for this project presented unique challenges. Collaborating with a diverse group of creative individuals—writers, musicians, and storytellers—was both inspiring and humbling. Initially, I received a collection of anonymous excerpts, each carrying its own distinct mood and tone. This required a thoughtful and empathetic approach to ensure the visual representations honored the essence of each story while contributing to the project&#x27;s unified identity.​</p>
        <p>Additionally, I considered the scalability of the design; the visual composition needed to look excellent both in small formats and as large posters at exhibitions, social media posts, and postcards. This required fine-tuning, working with line thickness, and finding the right font. The color palette also needed to transition perfectly from print to digital formats while remaining as consistent as possible.​</p>

        <p><strong>Exhibitions and Performances</strong></p>
        <p><strong><em>‍</em></strong><em>Bringing stories to life through design and space</em></p>
        <p>Voice Notes has been showcased internationally, with live performances and installations at the Arbat Refugee Camp (Kurdistan Region of Iraq), Space21 Sound Festival (Slemani), New Art Exchange (Nottingham), Yorkton Workshops (London), and Dr Guislain Museum (Ghent, Belgium) in November 2024. In 2025, the project was featured at the PRS New Music Biennial in Bradford, London, and Newcastle. </p>
        <p>At the heart of the Voice Notes installation are the personal stories of young individuals who have experienced displacement. These narratives are presented through a combination of visual and auditory elements, creating a multidimensional experience. Visitors navigate through themes of home, loss, belonging, and connection, engaging with the stories from various perspectives.​</p>
        <p>My role as a designer was to ensure that the visual identity of the project seamlessly translated into the physical exhibition space. This involved creating materials that complemented the auditory components, striking a balance between clarity and emotional resonance, and allowing the visual elements to support the powerful stories being told.​</p>
        <p>Following the exhibition in Nottingham, I engaged in a collaboration with Nottingham Contemporary. This city has since become a significant crossroads in my creative journey, where professional growth, community engagement, and personal development converge.​</p>
        <p>This project marked several milestones in my career. Participating in writing workshops in a second language helped me gain confidence in expressing ideas not only visually but also verbally. These experiences encouraged me to explore new strategies for finding my voice in design, both literally and conceptually.​</p>

        <p><strong>What Others Say</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“Ganna is wonderful, and super-talented! From designing the exhibition and printed materials to developing the full website, her work on Voice Notes was consistently brilliant. She managed a complex and ambitious visual brief with creativity, clarity, and care. We were so impressed by how seamlessly she integrated different design elements and brought the stories of the project to life. I can’t thank her enough and would recommend her without hesitation.”</blockquote>
        <p>— Dr. Sarah Jackson, Project Lead, Voice Notes</p>
        <blockquote>“Beautiful work, Ganna! LOVE LOVE LOVE! You brought so much care, creativity, and attention to this project. The designs speak for themselves — and truly elevate the work. We’re deeply grateful. We’re aware of how much time and dedication you’ve given beyond the original scope — your contribution has gone far beyond what the budget could reflect. We sincerely hope to collaborate again soon.”</blockquote>
        <p>— Leah Gayer, Creative Producer, Compass Collective</p>
        <blockquote>“Huge thanks for all your incredible work on Voice Notes. It’s been such a pleasure to collaborate with you. You’ve brought thoughtful vision and such a strong sense of design to every stage of the project.”</blockquote>
        <p>— Creative Team and Contributors, Voice Notes</p>
        <blockquote>More than a professional opportunity, Voice Notes became a space for growth, dialogue, and reflection. It deepened my understanding of how graphic design can serve as a powerful storytelling tool, connecting people across languages and geographies. I leave this project with a stronger creative voice, a broader perspective, and lasting inspiration to continue using design in service of empathy, visibility, and change.​</blockquote>
